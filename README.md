# pokemon-card-collector

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

## About

A Web application for people who want to look up Pokemon cards.

## Motivation

I wanted to build a website that connects to a public API.  I chose Pokemon TCG
because I like Pokemon and I enjoy the fun, colorful images on the cards.  Users
can use the website to see every Pokemon card ever released starting with the
latest pack.  The website also provides links on where to purchase a particular
card.
